Unlike frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, JJ doesn't have a huge API surface mainly because:

- It doesn't try to duplicate the features of modern browsers. It merely adds sugar syntax for the most common use cases.
- It doesn't try to create a thick abstraction. You can read the entire code in 10-15 minutes and know exactly how it works.
- It mimics the naming convention from DOM API. Instead of using proprietary docs, you can just guess what's already there.
- It is essentially a tiny library. There's only so much that can fit here.

But still, you're here because you want to learn something, so let's get to it.
