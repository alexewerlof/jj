        <p>Unlike frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, JJ doesn't have a huge API surface mainly because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It doesn't try to duplicate the features of modern browsers. It merely adds sugar syntax for the most
                common use cases.
            </li>
            <li>
                It mimics the naming convention from DOM API. Instead of using proprietary docs, you can just guess
                what's already there.
            </li>
            <li>It is essentially a tiny library. There's only so much that can fit here.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But still, you're here because you want to learn something, so let's get to it.</p>
